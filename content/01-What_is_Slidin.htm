			<h1>What is Slidin?</h1>
			<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
			<p><a href="http://slidin.andrewh.ca" target="_blank">Slidin'</a> is the result of <a href="http://www.sfu.ca" target="_blank">SFU's</a> <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/content/sfu/tlc/programming/mediaprotege/general.html" target="_blank">EdMedia Program</a>, in which instructors were given the opportunity to develop some form of educational media for their courses.</p>
			<p>In response, Slidin' is a combination of <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/" target="_blank">deck.js</a>, <a href="http://codemirror.net/" target="_blank">CodeMirror</a> and some PHP + Web Magics to make for a slightly more easily deployed slide deck which builds automatically around a given file structure. It also has some functionality pre-embedded, mostly in response to it's "testing phase" in <a href="http://iat381.andrewh.ca" target="_blank">IAT-381: Web Design &amp; Development</a></p>

			<h1>Why make it?</h1>
			<h2>The goals</h2>
			<p>Given the context of <a href="http://iat381.andrewh.ca" target="_blank">IAT-381: Web Design &amp; Development</a> this is an experiment in slides that leverage the malleability of web-content to see if it could benefit student learning of course material both inside and outside of the lecture.</p>
			<p>Slidin' is mostly leveraging existing code (ie. <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/" target="_blank">deck.js</a>) to make an easily replicable and deployable package for different courses.</p>

			<h1>What it is</h1>
			<h2>1. Responsive</h2>
			<p>It will adapt to different devices (mobile or desktop) and present the material in an accessible fashion on each of these devices.</p>

			<h1>What it is</h1>
			<h2>2. Accessible</h2>
			<p>HTML5 is another step closer to proper, semantic, markup. Content is marked up in such a way to provide clear hierarchy for accessibility devices. <span class="whisper">Some further improvement on Slidin's part is still required here.</span></p>

<h2>3. Interactive</h2>
<p>Any interactivity afforded to websites can be embedded in the slides.</p>

			<h1>What it is</h1>
			<h2>4. Agnostic</h2>
			<p>It is platform agnostic, not requiring one particular piece of software to open or edit. You could even use Notepad or Textedit to build your slides.</p>

			<h2>1. Powerpoint++</h2>

			<h1>Considerations</h1>
			<h2>1. Students</h2>
			<p class="question">What do your students need from their slides?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do they bring laptops to class?</li>
				<li>Will you expect them to follow the slides digitally?</li>
				<li>Are your students typically hand note-takers?</li>
				<li>Will they make use of the after-lecture interaction?</li>
				<li>Can the rich-media interaction offer something of benefit to learning?</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="slide" id="considerations-copyright">
		
			<h1>Considerations</h1>
			<h2>2. Copyright</h2>
			<p class="question">Yarrr?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you willing to cite all your sources?</li>
				<li>Is there any material you've taken in a 'quasi-ethical' fashion?</li>
				<li>Keep in mind it is easier to link from online repositories such as Youtube</li>
			</ul>
			
		</section>
		
		
		
		<section class="slide" id="considerations-shiny">
		
			<h1>Considerations</h1>
			<h2>3. Shiny-ness</h2>
			<p class="question">Can you say you are using Slidin' for good? <span class="whisper">not evil</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you actually using web-specific features?</li>
				<li>Have you forced Tufte's kitten-killing hand?</li>
				<li>Are you overhauling an entire course at the same time?</li>
				<li><em>Make sure you have course-specific reasons before trying it out</em></li>
			</ul>

		<section class="slide" id="considerations-coding">
		
			<h1>Considerations</h1>
			<h2>4. Coding</h2>
			<p class="question">Do you know HTML/CSS/JS?</p>
			<p>Leveraging the capabilities of the internet does require an understanding of how to script online. Your understanding of web-based coding is the main factor contributing to your ability to employ highly interactive experiences for your students inside and outside the lecture hall.</p>
			
		</section>
		
		
		
		<section class="slide" id="steps">
		
			<h1>Steps to using Slidin'</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Is it just shiny? (Identify a need)</li>
				<li>Is now the time? (Assess the need)</li>
				<li>Do I have time? (Test the need)</li>
				<li>Live &amp; learn (Rinse, repeat)</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Things I've learned so far</h1>
			<h2>The redux</h2>
			<p>Even given the brief period in which this has been employed, there are some important notes to be made:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Make it printable:</em> A good number of students still take written notes</li>
				<li><em>Lecture still matters:</em> Interaction is lovely, but the content still needs context</li>
				<li><em>Out-of-class time:</em> Leveraging potential out-of-class interaction is key</li>
			</ul>
