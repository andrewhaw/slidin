			<h1>Welcome to Slidin</h1>
		
			<p>This is a brief introduction on how to set up Slidin' on your own server. To install Slidin', you will require:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A server with PHP 5 or higher</li>
				<li>FTP access</li>
				<li>An understanding of HTML markup</li>
				<li>Some patience</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Download Slidin'</h1>
		
			<p>The first step is to <a href="/dls/Slidin-v0.1.zip">download Slidin'</a>. In that folder you will find a series of files you should upload to your server. Once uploaded, visit the URL you have uploaded the files to and see if the basic template still loads.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if you upload Slidin' to the main level of your website (ie. spatula.ca/slidin/), visit that folder to access the main page.</p>

			<h1>Common Install Problems</h1>
		
			<p>Common issues when installing Slidin' may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod">File permission errors</a>; files should be set to 644 and folders to 755</li>
				<li>.htaccess problems; ensure your server allows mod_rewriting</li>
				<li>Can't access the index; ensure the folder has uploaded and you can run .PHP files</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="slide" id="slidin-basics-structure">
			
			<h1>Slidin' Basics</h1>
			<h2>File structure</h2>
		
			<p>Slidin automatically maps any .htm files in the 'content' folder to a URL. For example, if you have a file called <em>'Test-Presentation.htm'</em>, the presentation would be accessible through <em>yoururl.ca/slidin/Test-Presentation</em> and would also be listed along with any other .htm files (in the content folder) on the main page at yoururl.ca/slidin/</p>

		<section class="slide" id="slidin-basics-setup">
			
			<h1>Slidin' Basics</h1>
			<h2>Setup</h2>
		
			<p>Make sure to edit the <em>'setup.php'</em> file available in the <em>'inc'</em> folder to set a standard title for all your slide decks. It also allows you to change the file-type extension used for slide decks (from the default .htm), though you should only consider changing it if you are looking to run custom server-side (ie. PHP) scripts in your decks themselves.</p>

		<section class="slide" id="slidin-basics-markup">
			
			<h1>Slidin' Basics</h1>
			<h2>Markup</h2>
		
			<p>Markup for Slidin' is like coding a webpage. There are two main pieces of code that are absolutely necessary, and any other code can be injected later on:</p>
			<p><strong>&lt;article class="slide-deck"&gt;</strong> - Every slide deck must be wrapped in this tag for the deck to work.</p>
			<p><strong>&lt;section class="slide"&gt;</strong> - Every slide must be wrapped in this tag as otherwise the slide transitioning will not work. </p>
			<p><a href="#slidin-basics-markup-example" class="next">The next slide</a> has an example.</p>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Some slide content&lt;p&gt;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;/section&gt;</strong><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&lt;section class="slide"&gt;</strong><br>

			<h1>Slidin' Basics</h1>

		<section class="slide" id="slidin-advanced-markup">
			
			<h1>Slidin' Advanced</h1>
			<h2>Markup</h2>
		
			<p>To ensure that your slides can be accessed directly after the fact, add a meaningful id to each slide's <em>&lt;section&gt;</em> tag:<br>
			&lt;section class="slide" <strong>id="slidin-advanced-markup"</strong>&gt;</p>
			<p>Adding an id means that your slides will each be uniquely accessible through the URL for your slides, in addition to #id (ie. yoururl.ca/slidin/A-Presentation#id)</p>

				
		</section>


	
		<section class="slide" id="slidin-advanced-styling">
			
			<h1>Slidin' Advanced</h1>
			<h2>Styling and Interaction</h2>
		
			<p>To apply custom styles or interactions to specific elements of your slide deck, you can build your own CSS or JS files. Slidin' has been set up to look for a folder and CSS file which share the same name of your slide deck's .htm file.</p>
			<p>For example, for <em>'A-Presentation.htm'</em>, Slidin' will look for a folder in 'content' that is called <em>'A-Presentation'</em>. If there is a <em>'A-Presentation.css'</em> or <em>'A-Presentation.js'</em> file in there, Slidin' will automatically apply them to the associated slide deck.</p>
			<p>Slidin uses the jQuery library to ease building custom interactions.</p>
